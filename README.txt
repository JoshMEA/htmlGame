# htmlGame
A small game to practice my HTML5, CSS3 and JS.

I wasn't really interested in learning to create a game using HTML Canvas, as I wanted to practice DOM manipulation.
Game doesn't have a storyline set as yet, and the visuals won't be too crash hot, as this is just to practice my skills using ES6.
Gameplay style will be more like an interactive comic(?) with static artworks set as the game scenes, JRPG style battles and
levelling systems, and maybe some simple puzzles.
